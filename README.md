# Employee Evaluation for Promotion using ML and Eval Auto ML

The main aim of this project is to predict whether an employee should be promoted or not, using automated Machine Learning Techniques.

### Motivation
The HR team stored data on the promotion cycle last year, which  consists of detail of all the employees in the company working last year and whether they got promoted or not. But every time this process gets delayed due to so many details available for each employee, it gets challenging to compare and decide.

### Why Eval Ml?
Eval ML is an open-source Auto Machine Learning in Python that automated a large part of the machine learning process and we can quickly evaluate which machine learning pipeline works better for the given set of data.

### Time Line of the Project
- Data Analysis (Finding out different relations)
- Feature Engineering (Processing data before feeding to model)
- Model Building using Machine Learning (Using ML/DL Algorithms)
- Model Building using Auto Machine Learning
